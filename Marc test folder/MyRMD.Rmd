## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

**Bold - faced **
*italicized text*
*** bold and italicized ***

List:

- Item 1  
- Item 2 yes  
- Item 3 yes what what  

$f(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^{2}}}e^{-\frac{1}{2} \left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)^{2}}$

\textcolor{red}{yes}

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
#Section 1

## Subection of Section 1

### Sub-subsection of Section 1

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
